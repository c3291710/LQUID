#LIQUID
Liver Function Quantification using clinical MRI data.
This project utilises clinical low-temporal resolution DCE-MRI with Gadoxetate to generate function map for function avoidance treatment planning.
The LTR-DCE MRI comprises non-contrast image volume, arterial phase, portovenous phase, delayed phase, 7-min delayed phase, 15-min delayed phase, and 20-min delayed phase (hepatobiliary phase image volumes.
The method is based on truncated singular value decomposition based deconvolution method.
